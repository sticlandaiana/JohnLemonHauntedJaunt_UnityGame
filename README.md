# JohnLemonHauntedJaunt_UnityGame
This is a 3D stealth game made in Unity, based on the classic Unity Learn tutorial. You play as John Lemon, trying to escape from a haunted house without being seen by ghosts that patrol the rooms.

I added this new feature: a special collectible that shows a quiz question when picked up. If you answer correctly, John Lemon gets teleported closer to the exit. It's a fun way to mix puzzles with the original stealth gameplay.
